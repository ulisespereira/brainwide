# README: Cognitive Network Interactions through Communication Subspaces

This repository contains the code and data necessary to reproduce the main results from the manuscript:  
**"Cognitive network interactions through communication subspaces in large-scale models of the neocortex"**

---

## 1. System Requirements

### Software Dependencies

Please ensure the following Python packages are installed:

- Python >= 3.8  
- PyTorch >= 1.12  
- NumPy >= 1.21  
- SciPy >= 1.7  
- Matplotlib >= 3.5  
- pandas >= 1.3  
- Jupyter Notebook >= 6.0  

## Operating Systems
Tested on:

macOS 12-15 

Hardware Requirements
A standard laptop or desktop with at least 8 GB RAM

## 2. Installation Guide
# Steps
Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/ulisespereira/brainwide.git```

(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```
Typical install time on a desktop computer is less than 20s.

## 3. Demo
Running the Demo

Please run the jupyter notebooks correspodning to figures 2-7 to repreducing al the figures on the paper.

Expected run time for a full network simulation (the most computationally intensive part of the code) is approximately 1â€“3 minutes on a standard desktop computer.

## 4. Instructions for Use

Open one of the notebooks in the notebooks/ folder and run the cells sequentially.

Modify model parameters as needed in the cell blocks to test alternative hypotheses or reproduce custom simulations.
